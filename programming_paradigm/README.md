🐍 Python Backend — ALX Backend Engineering

This repository contains my solutions and practice work for the ALX Backend Engineering track. I’m currently focused on Python, especially classes and OOP concepts.
The goal of this stage is to learn how to structure programs, model real-world problems, and write cleaner, more maintainable code.

📌 What I’m Working On

Understanding how classes and objects work

Defining attributes and methods

Writing constructors (__init__)

Using inheritance and encapsulation

Building small programs that follow OOP principles

📁 Structure

Each project folder contains:

Task files

Example scripts

Notes or explanations when needed

I’m keeping everything simple, readable, and aligned with ALX project requirements.

🎯 Purpose

This repo tracks my progress and helps me build confidence in Python’s OOP features. It also serves as a reference for later backend projects where solid class design matters.
